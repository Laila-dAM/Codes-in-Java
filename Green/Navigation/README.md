Create a simple underwater navigation game where the player must avoid obstacles (such as corals and fish) and collect treasures at the bottom of the sea. Components: The game should feature a graphical interface (using simple keyboard characters like kaomoji) with a screen representing the sea floor and the submarine's position controlled by the player. The player should use the arrow keys to move the submarine up, down, left, and right. The game should randomly generate obstacles and treasures on the sea floor, with the goal of avoiding obstacles and collecting as many treasures as possible. Challenge: Implement a scoring system based on the number of treasures collected and the time the player survives without crashing into obstacles.
